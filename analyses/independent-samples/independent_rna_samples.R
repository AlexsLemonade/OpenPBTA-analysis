# independent_rna_samples.R

#' Generate a vector of unique rna samples
#' 
#' The samples from this function will be unique with respect to participants
#' i.e. only no two samples will come from the same participant. The input list 
#' should be pre-filtered by `composition` and `sample_type`.  
#' 
#' 
#' @param independent_dna_sample_df A data frame of samples, with columns 
#' corresponding to those in `independent-specimens.wgswxspanel.primary.tsv` 
#' or `independent-specimens.wgswxspanel.relapse.tsv` 
#' or `independent-specimens.wgswxspanel.primary-plus.tsv` depending on what 
#' set of samples you need to include
#' @param histology_df A data frame of samples, with columns corresponding 
#' to those `histologies.tsv`
#' @param independent_level Designates whether we want to count independent samples in 
#' different cohorts as independent or not. "all-cohorts" consider the same sampe
#' in different cohorts as the same sample and "each-cohort" consider the same sample
#' in different cohorts as "independent" (different). 
#' @param match_type Designates which type matching needs to be done. Options
#' are "independent_dna" to include only rna samples that match the 
#' independent-specimens.wgswxspanel sample set, 
#' "independent_dna_plus_only_rna" to include samples that macth the dna sample 
#' set plus include samples where only rna samples exists
#' @param tumor_description_rna_only Tumor descriptors to select samples where
#' only RNA samples are available and will have no matching id in independent_dna_sample_df
#' Opetions are "primary" to select only primary/initial tumors. Primary tumors are defined as those designated "Initial CNS Tumor"+ "Primary Tumor".
#' "primary_plus" if you would like to select other non-initial tumor RNA-Seq sample if no 
#' initial tumor RNA-Seq sample exists
#' or "relapse" in select only relapse tumors. Relapse tumors are defined as those designated by "Recurrence", "Recurrent Tumor","Recurrent tumor","Progressive","Progressive Disease Post-Mortem" in `tumor_descriptor` field
#' @param seed An optional random number seed. 
#' 
#' @return a data frame of Participant and Specimen IDs, each present only once.
