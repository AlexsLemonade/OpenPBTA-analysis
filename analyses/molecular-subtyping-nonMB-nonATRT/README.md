# Molecular subtyping of non-MB and non-ATRT Embryonal Tumors

Written by Stephanie J. Spielman. 

The primary goals of this analysis, [per Issue #251](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/issues/251) are to:

1. Subtype embryonal tumors that are _not_ MB or ATRT into ETMRs and CNS embryonal NOS
2. Identify whether any existing subtypings should be amended

**This analysis is a work in progress.**

+ `01-subtyping.Rmd` performs molecular subtyping, currently with UMAP on stranded RNA-seq expression data

+ `plots/umap_expression_all_embryonal.pdf` displays initial UMAP results, considering _all_ embryonal tumors for a cursory view of their separation
