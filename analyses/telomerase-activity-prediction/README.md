Telomerase Activity Prediction

Module Authors: Nighat Noureen and Siyuan Zheng. 

Goals include:

1. Predict telomerase activities using gene expression data.

2. Analyze the variations in telomerase activities across polyA and stranded data sets.

3. Analyze the correlation of telomerase activities with TERT and TERC genes expression across polyA and stranded data sets.

4. Analyze the distribution of telomerase activities across different histologies (used short and broad histologies from the clinical data)

5. Generate plots for the analysis modules.




Scripts and Results:

1. RUN-telomerase-activity-prediction.sh to generate the telomerase activities from expression data.
2. Analysis-telomerase-activity.sh to perform comparative analysis.
