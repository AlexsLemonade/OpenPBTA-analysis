This notebook defines the most focal recurrent copy number units by removing focal changes that are within entire chromosome arm losses and gains.
_Most focal_ here meaning:

- If a chromosome arm is not clearly defined as a gain or loss (and is callable) we look to define the cytoband level status
- If a cytoband is not clearly defined as a gain or loss (and is callable) we then look to define the gene-level status

## Usage

This notebook is intended to be run from the command line with the following (assumes you are in the root directory of the repository):

```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analyses/focal-cn-file-preparation/05-define-most-focal-cn-units.Rmd', clean = TRUE, params=list(is_ci = ${IS_CI}))"
```

### Cutoffs: 

```{r}
# The fraction of calls a particular status needs to be
# above to be called the majority status -- the decision
# for a cutoff of 90% here was made to ensure that the status
# is not only the majority status but it is also significantly
# called more than the other status values in the region
percent_threshold <- 0.9

# The fraction threshold for determining if enough of a region
# (arm, cytoband, or gene) is callable to determine its status --
# the decision for a cutoff of 50% here was made as it seems reasonable
# to expect a region to be more than 50% callable for a dominant status
# call to be made
uncallable_threshold <- 0.5
```

  #
  # Args:

### Files and directories

```{r}
results_dir <- "results"

# Define a logical object for running in CI
running_in_ci <- params$is_ci
```

### Read in files

Read in cytoband status file and format it for what we will need in this notebook. 

```{r}
# Read in the file with consensus CN status data and the UCSC cytoband data --
# generated in `03-add-cytoband-status-consensus.Rmd`
consensus_seg_cytoband_status_df <-
  read_tsv(file.path("results", "consensus_seg_with_ucsc_cytoband_status.tsv.gz")) %>%
  # Need this to not have `chr`
  mutate(
    chr = gsub("chr", "", chr),
    cytoband = paste0(chr, cytoband)
  ) %>%
  select(
    chromosome_arm,
    # Distinguish this dominant status that is based on cytobands, from the status
    dominant_cytoband_status = dominant_status,
    cytoband,
    Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID
  )
```

Read in the chromosome-level and gene-level data. 

```{r}
# Read in the annotated gene level CN file
consensus_seg_autosomes_df <-
  read_tsv(file.path(results_dir, "consensus_seg_annotated_cn_autosomes.tsv.gz"))
```

Joining the gene-level and cytoband-level into one data frame.

```{r}
combined_status_df <- consensus_seg_autosomes_df %>%
  inner_join(
    consensus_seg_cytoband_status_df,
    by = c("biospecimen_id" = "Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID", "cytoband")
  )
```

## Define most focal units

### Determine chromosome arm status

```{r}
# Use our custom function to make the status calls
arm_status_count <- status_majority_caller(
  combined_status_df,
  "chromosome_arm",
  "status",
  "biospecimen_id",
  percent_threshold
)

# Display table
arm_status_count %>%
  group_by(dominant_status)
```

These are the chromosome arms that have not been defined as gain or loss -- we want to define their cytoband/gene-level status

```{r}
# Let's get a vector of the neutral arms
neutral_arms <- arm_status_count %>%
  filter(dominant_status == "neutral") %>%
  dplyr::pull("chromosome_arm")
```

### Determine cytoband status

We want to include cytoband and gene-level calls for chromosome arms that have not been defined as a gain or loss.

```{r}
# Filter the annotated CN data to include only neutral chromosome arms
neutral_status_arm_df <- combined_status_df %>%
  filter(chromosome_arm %in% neutral_arms)
```

Making cytoband-level majority calls. 

```{r}
# Now count the cytoband level calls (for each status call) and define
# the cytoband as that status if more than 50% of the total counts are
# for that particular status
cytoband_status_count <- status_majority_caller(
  neutral_status_arm_df,
  "cytoband",
  "dominant_cytoband_status",
  "biospecimen_id",
  percent_threshold
)

# Display table
cytoband_status_count %>%
  group_by(dominant_status)
```

### Determine gene-level status

```{r}
# These are the cytobands that have not been defined as gain or loss --
# we want to define their gene-level status
neutral_cytobands <- cytoband_status_count %>%
  filter(dominant_status %in% c("unstable", "NA")) %>%
  dplyr::pull("cytoband")

# Filter the annotated CN data to include only these cytobands
neutral_status_cytoband_df <- combined_status_df %>%
  filter(cytoband %in% neutral_cytobands)
```

```{r}
if (!(running_in_ci)) {
  # Now count the gene-level calls (for each status call) and define
  # the gene as that status if more than 50% of the total counts are
  # for that particular status
  gene_status_count <- status_majority_caller(
    neutral_status_cytoband_df,
    "gene_symbol",
    "status",
    "biospecimen_id",
    percent_threshold
  )

  # Display table
  gene_status_count
}
```

## Plot calls

Plot the final dominant status call on the x-axis and the percent of each status on the y-axis.

### Plot chromosome arm status calls

```{r}
# Run `plot_dominant_status_calls` function for the chromosome arm calls
plot_dominant_status_calls(
  arm_status_count
)
```

### Plot cytoband status calls

```{r fig.width = 10}
# Run `plot_dominant_status_calls` function for the cytoband calls
plot_dominant_status_calls(
  cytoband_status_count
)
```

### Plot gene status calls

```{r}
if (!(running_in_ci)) {
  # Run `plot_dominant_status_calls` function for the gene-level calls
  plot_dominant_status_calls(gene_status_count)
}
```

## Combine arm, cytoband, and gene-level status data

```{r}
# For each of the datasets we're joining, we'll only keep these columns:
cols_to_keep <- c("biospecimen_id", "dominant_status")
```

Combine into one long data frame

```{r}
if (!(running_in_ci)) {
  # Combine the arm, cytoband, and gene status count data
  final_df <- bind_rows(
    arm = select(arm_status_count,
      cols_to_keep,
      region = chromosome_arm
    ),
    cytoband = select(cytoband_status_count,
      cols_to_keep,
      region = cytoband
    ),
    gene = select(gene_status_count,
      cols_to_keep,
      region = gene_symbol
    ),
    .id = "region_type"
  ) %>%
    # Reorder columns more sensibly
    select(
      Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID = biospecimen_id,
      status = dominant_status,
      region,
      region_type
    )
} else {
  # Combine the arm and cytoband status count data
  final_df <- bind_rows(
    arm = select(arm_status_count,
      cols_to_keep,
      region = chromosome_arm
    ),
    cytoband = select(cytoband_status_count,
      cols_to_keep,
      region = cytoband
    ),
    .id = "region_type"
  ) %>%
    # Reorder columns more sensibly
    select(
      Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID = biospecimen_id,
      status = dominant_status,
      region,
      region_type
    )
}

# Print out preview
final_df
```

## Write to a TSV file 

```{r}
# Write final long status table to file
write_tsv(
  final_df,
  file.path(results_dir, "consensus_seg_most_focal_cn_status.tsv.gz")
)

# Display final long status table
final_df %>%
  arrange(region_type)
```
