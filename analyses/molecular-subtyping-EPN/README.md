# Molecular Subtyping of Ependymoma

<b>Module Authors:</b> Teja Koganti(<a href="https://github.com/tkoganti">@tkoganti</a>) and Josh Shapiro(<a href="https://github.com/jashapiro">@jashapiro</a>)

In this analysis we subtype ependymoma samples based on fusions, CNV, NFKB_pathway_GSEAscore, breaks_density-chromosomal_instability_CNV, breaks_density-chromosomal_instability_SV, GISTIC_focal_CN_CDKN2A and gene expression data

## Usage
`bash run-molecular-subtyping-EPN.sh`

This above  script is designed to change to this directory to run, so it should run from any location.

## Folder content

1. <b>`00-subset-for-EPN.R`</b> is a script that takes subsets only  ependymoma samples expression data for CI. The script uses `pbta-histologies.tsv` file to filter for ependymoma samples and     `pbta-gene-expression-rsem-fpkm-collapsed.stranded.rds` file for expression  data

2. <b>`01-make_notebook_RNAandDNA.py`</b> is a script that filters WGS  and RNA-seq ependymoma samples from `pbta-histologies.tsv` file and adds `disease_group` column to the output file based on the primary_site. The values for `disease_group` are supratentorial/infratentorial/undetermined

3. <b>`02_ependymoma_generate_all_data.py`</b>  is a script that takes in expression, GISTIC, fusion, breakpoint, GISTIC, GSVA files to add values from these tables as new columns to the input notebook. Output from `01-make_notebook_RNAandDNA.py` script is used as input notebook. The output notebook from this is saved to `results/EPN_all_data.tsv`

4. <b> `03-subgrouping_samples.py`  </b>  is a script that takes the table `results/EPN_all_data.tsv`  as input and adds a column that groups the samples into one of these groups - ST-EPN-RELA, ST-EPN-YAP1, PF-EPN-A, and PF-EPN-B. A new column named `subgroup` is added to the input table and saved in `results/EPN_all_data_withsubgroup.tsv`.
  - This script prioritizes features of subgroups first and does not assign those samples to any other subgroups. For example `RELA` fusions are prioritized for `ST_EPN_RELA` subgroup and not assigedn to any other  groups. Two functions help achieve this in the script - 1) `prioritized_fusion` for `ST-SPN_RELA` and `ST-EPN-YAP1` groups and 2) `prioritizing_PT_EPN` for `PT_EPN_A` and `PT_EPN_B` groups

  - There is another function `subgroup_func` that checks that samples are not in `samples_assigned`  list  and checks the  value of certain columns and assigns subgroups to samples accordingly.

  - From the [input file here](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/blob/master/analyses/molecular-subtyping-EPN/results/EPN_all_data.tsv) values for various columns are considered for assigning subgroups. Following are  the columns and values used (prioritized column shows `yes`, then samples  that have  that feature are ONLY assigned to that subgroup) -

        -   The following formula was implemented for these two columns `breaks_density-chromosomal_instability_CNV` and `breaks_density-chromosomal_instability_SV` from input table and the values were added as column names `SV instability` and `CNV instability`

                `(break density value for sample - median) / interquartile range`
