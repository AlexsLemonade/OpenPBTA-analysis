# Molecular Subtyping of Low Grade Gliomaa

**Module authors:** Krutika Gaonkar ([@kgaonkar6](https://github.com/kgaonkar6)), Jaclyn Taroni ([@jaclyn-taroni](https://github.com/jaclyn-taroni))

In this analysis we subtype LGAT samples according to the presence/absence of molecular alterations decribed below and originally discussed in #790(https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/issues/790):

- **LGG, NF1-somatic**
  - This subtype is characterized by somatic _NF1_ variants.

- **LGG, NF1-germline**
  - We do not have germline data within OpenPBTA, but we do have information about cancer predispositions. This group can be annotated by checking for `NF-1` within `cancer_predispositions` field of the `pbta-histologies.tsv` file. 

- **LGG, KIAA1549-BRAF**
  - contains _KIAA1549-BRAF_ fusion

- **LGG, BRAF V600E**
  - contains BRAF V600E or V599 SNV or non-canonical _BRAF_ alterations such as p.V600ins or p.D594N within the kiinase (PK_Tyr_Ser-Thr) domain.

- **LGG, other MAPK**
  - contains non-canonical _BRAF_ fusion other than _KIAA1549-BRAF_
  - contains _RAF1_ fusion
  - contains _KRAS_, _NRAS_, _HRAS_, _MAP2K1_, _MAP2K2_, _MAP2K1_, _ARAF_, _RAF1_ and BRAF (other than V600E or V599 SNV and other mutations in kinase domain) SNV or indel

- **LGG, RTK**
  - harbors a fusion in _ALK_, _ROS1_, _NTRK1_, _NTRK2_, or _NTRK3_ **or**
  - harbors a _MET_ SNV **or 
  - harbors a _KIT_ SNV **or**
  - harbors a _PDGFRA_ SNV or fusion

- **LGG, FGFR**
  - harbors _FGFR1_ p.N546K, p.K656E, p.N577, or p. K687 hotspot mutations **or** 
  - harbors _FGFR1_ TKD (tyrosine kinase domain tandem duplication) **or**
  - harbors _FGFR1-TACC1_ fusion **or 
  - harbors _FGFR1_ or _FGFR2_ fusions

- **LGG, IDH**
  - harbors an _IDH_ R132 mutation

- **LGG, H3**
  - harbors an _H3F3A_ K28M or G35R/V mutation **or**
  - harbors an _H3F3B_,_HIST1H3B_,_HIST1H3C_,_HIST2H3C_ K28M mutation

- **LGG, MYB/MYBL1**
  - harbors either a _MYB-QKI_ fusion or other _MYB_ or _MYBL1_ fusion

- **LGG, CDKN2A/B** 
  - harbors focal CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B  deletion
  - This is a secondary co-occurring alteration with prognostic significance. 


### Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Samples are _included_ for subtyping if we detect the following strings in the `pathology_diagnosis` field of `pbta-histologies.tsv`:

```
low-grade glioma/astrocytoma
ganglioglioma
```

Samples are _excluded_ if we detect the following strings in the `pathology_diagnosis` field of `pbta-histologies.tsv`:

```
dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor
```

When `pathology_diagnosis == "Low-grade glioma/astrocytoma (WHO grade I/II)"`, we will _recode_ samples if we detect the following strings in `pathology_free_text_diagnosis` as "GNT, <subtype>" :

```
desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma
glioneuronal
```

These strings are stored in `lgat-subset/lgat_subtyping_path_dx_strings.json`, which is the output of the `00-LGAT-select-pathology-dx.R`. 

Prior to `release-v17-20200908`, we used `short_histology == "LGAT"` as our inclusion criteria.


### Preprocessing

The files in the `lgat-subset` were generated via `01-subset-files-for-LGAT.R` using files from the `release-v18-20201123`. If running locally using [the instructions below](#run-script), new `lgat-subset` files will be generated using the files symlinked in `data/`.

### Inputs from data download

* `pbta-histologies.tsv`: is used to subset samples according to [the criteria above](#inclusion-exclusion-criteria)
* `pbta-snv-consensus-mutation.maf.tsv.gz`: from `snv-callers` module which gathers calls that are present in all 3 callers (strelka2,mutect2 and lancet) 
* `pbta-snv-scavenged-hotspots.maf.tsv.gz`: from `hotspot-detection` module to gather calls that overlap MSKCC hotspots found in any caller (except if only vardict calls the site as variant, we remove these calls since we have a lot of calls unique to vardict which we consider as false positive as discussed [here](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/tree/master/analyses/snv-callers#snv-caller-comparison-analysis))

### Run script

```sh
bash run_subtyping.sh
```

This does not run the `00-v17-LGAT-select-pathology-dx` notebook, as that is intended to be run once and tied to a specific release (`release-v17-20200908`).
