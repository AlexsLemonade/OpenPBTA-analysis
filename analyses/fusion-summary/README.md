# Fusion Summary

This module generates summary files for fusions of interest present in biospecimens taken from:

1. Ependymoma tumors
2. Embryonal tumors not from ATRT or MB

To generate the tables run:

```
bash run-new-analysis.sh
```

## General Use

The program generates files that contain information about the presence or absence of specific fusions or genes participating in fusions.
These can be potentially used for further downstream molecular subtyping analyses.
