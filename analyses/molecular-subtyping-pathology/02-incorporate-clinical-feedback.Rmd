As part of molecular-subtype-HGG analysis we assign a HGG or DMG subtype from looking for K28M histone variants, in this notebook we are identifying samples which have differences between the clinically reviewed subtype and subtype from molecular-subtype-HGG module in PNOC003 and update
those to the clinical subtypes

Adding information from the original [issue](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/issues/751) added by @jharenza 
 
**UPDATE 2020-10-05** 
Below is a double-reviewed (by Cassie Kline and myself) table of histone mutations found in the specified patient tumor per the TGEN genomic reports.

Identify pnoc003 samples that have differences between clinical review subtype
and molecular subtype from histone variant mutation status

```{r}
diff_subtype <- subtype %>% left_join(pnoc003_review,by=c("Kids_First_Participant_ID","tumor_descriptor")) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    # checking for samples where clinically reviewed subtype is H3 WT
    # but molecular subtype is not HGG
    (grepl("H3 WT",.$`H3 Status`) & !grepl("HGG",molecular_subtype)) |
    # checking for samples where clinically reviewed subtype is H3 K28M
    # but molecular subtype is not DMG H3 K28
    (grepl("K28M",.$`H3 Status`) & !grepl("DMG, H3 K28",molecular_subtype)) | 
    # checking for samples were clinical review was not found  
    grepl("no report",.$`H3 Status`) )  %>%
  dplyr::select(Kids_First_Participant_ID,
                sample_id,
                `H3 Status`,
                molecular_subtype,
                tumor_descriptor) %>%
  distinct()

diff_subtype

```

Counts in each type of differences to identify how many samples already 
have subtyping updated from molecular-subtype-HGG module and how many
samples need molecular subtype updated from clinical review

```{r}

diff_subtype %>% 
  group_by(`H3 Status`,molecular_subtype) %>%
  tally()

```


Seems like 6 sample (WXS and matching RNA-Seq from PT_NK8A49X5, PT_QA9WJ679, PT_WGVEF96B) molecular subtype 
need to be updated and Notes columns for these samples will be updated to capture this 
information

```{r}
subtype_clinical_review_df <- subtype %>%
  # matching only on "Kids_First_Participant_ID","tumor_descriptor"
  left_join(pnoc003_review,by=c("Kids_First_Participant_ID","tumor_descriptor")) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
      # Since we have some additional values from IDH/BRAF alterations in 
      # molecular-subtping-HGG which are not part of the clinical review
      # I will be using `grepl` to check if the value from clinical review 
      # and molecular-subtyping-HGG values are different
    Notes =  case_when(
      # Don't think we would need to ever change from K28 to H3 wildtype
      # since there would be evidence for K28 from snv data for the sample
      # (grepl("H3 WT",.$`H3 Status`) & !grepl("HGG",molecular_subtype)) 
      # ~ paste(Notes,"Updated to HGG, H3 wildtype from clinical review",sep=","),
      #
      # IF we have K28M in clinical review and molecular subtype if not DMG K28M
      (grepl("K28M",.$`H3 Status`) & !grepl("DMG, H3 K28",molecular_subtype)) 
      # THEN the value in Notes will be updated to specify that the value is
      # updated because of clinical review
      ~ paste(Notes,"Updated to DMG, H3 K28 from clinical review", sep=","),
      # IF clinical review and molecular subtype match OR 
      # no clinical review is provided then keep values from Notes
      TRUE ~ Notes
    ),
    molecular_subtype =  case_when(
      # Don't think we would need to ever change from K28 to H3 wildtype
      # since there would be evidence for K28 from snv data for the sample
      #(grepl("H3 WT",.$`H3 Status`) & !grepl("HGG",molecular_subtype)) ~ 
      #  gsub("DMG, H3 K28","HGG, H3 wildtype",molecular_subtype),
      #
      # IF we have K28M in clinical review and molecular subtype if not DMG K28M
      (grepl("K28M",.$`H3 Status`) & !grepl("DMG, H3 K28",molecular_subtype)) ~ 
        # THEN the value in molecular subtype will be updated 
        gsub("HGG, H3 wildtype","DMG, H3 K28",molecular_subtype),
      # IF clinical review and molecular subtype match OR
      # no clinical review is provided then keep values from molecular subtype
      TRUE ~ molecular_subtype
    )
  ) %>%
  # remove extra columns 
  dplyr::select(-`H3 Status`) %>%
  write_tsv(file.path(output_file))
  
```
