#' @description CNS tumors have subtypes as per the [WHO 2016 CNS subtypes](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00401-016-1545-1.pdf). 
#' However, these are not captured in our molecular data so would need to be updated by
#' searching for terms in the reported pathology_free_text_diagnosis column in OpenPBTA histology file.
#' recode_integrated_diagnosis() can be used to recode a integreated_diagnosis based on the
#' pathology_free_text_diagnosis in addition to molecular subtypes.
#' @param histologies_df : Dataframe with Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID,Kids_First_Participant_ID,
#' sample_id,tumor_descriptor,pathology_free_text_diagnosis,broad_histology,short_histology,
#' molecular_subtype,integrated_diagnosis
#' @param pathology_diagnois : A term to filter histologies_df to samples that will be recoded
#' @param include_path_free_text_dx_terms : Regex term to match with values 
#' in pathology_free_text_diagnosis in histologies_df to be included in the recoding analysis
#' @param exclude_path_free_text_dx_terms : Default = NULL; Regex term to match with values in 
#' pathology_free_text_diagnosis in histologies_df to be excluded from the recoding analysis
#' @param old_integrated_diagnosis_term : Old term in integrated_diagnosis that should be replaced 
#' by replace_integrated_diagnosis_term
#' @param replace_integrated_diagnosis_term : New term for integrated_diagnosis that will replace 
#' an old integrated_term
