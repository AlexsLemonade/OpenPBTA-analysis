## Running GISTIC 2.0

**DISCLAIMER:** The `run-gistic` module **requires** the OpenPBTA project Docker container ([`ccdlopenpbta/open-pbta`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ccdlopenpbta/open-pbta)). 
The project Docker container requirement makes it distinct from other modules that are able to be run locally if you have the dependencies installed.
The code in this module uses absolute paths tied to the specific installation location on the project Docker image.

### Running GISTIC on the copy number consensus SEG file

By default, running the following will run GISTIC 2.0 on the SEG file generated by [`analyses/copy_number_consensus_call`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/tree/master/analyses/copy_number_consensus_call) that is included in the data download:

```
bash scripts/run-gistic-openpbta.sh
```

#### Running GISTIC using only a subset of samples

Running the following will generate **incomplete** GISTIC output for short histologies with greater than 100 samples:

```
bash run-gistic-module.sh
```

`run-gistic-module.sh` includes steps for generating array list files.
An array list file is (from the standalone GISTIC documentation included in the installation on the Docker container):

> The array list file is an optional file identifying the subset of samples to be used in the analysis.  It is a one column file with an optional header (array).  The sample identifiers listed in the array list file must match the sample names given in the segmentation file.  

The array list files are generated using the `scripts/generate-array-file.R` R script, which takes as arguments the histologies file (`pbta-histologies.tsv`) and a SEG file and will create files that contain biospecimen IDs that meet the following criteria: the biospecimen has the user-specified `filter_value` argument in the user-specified `filter_column` argument 2) the biospecimen ID is in the SEG file that will be used for GISTIC.

Currently, we generate array list files (see the `array_list_files` directory) filtering on the `short_histology` column of `pbta-histologies.tsv`.

Compressed GISTIC output folders are in `results`.

##### Why is the GISTIC output incomplete?

For runs using array list files, we see the following error at the broad analysis step:
