## Running GISTIC 2.0

**DISCLAIMER:** The `run-gistic` module **requires** the OpenPBTA project Docker container ([`ccdlopenpbta/open-pbta`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ccdlopenpbta/open-pbta)). 
The project Docker container requirement makes it distinct from other modules that are able to be run locally if you have the dependencies installed.
The code in this module uses absolute paths tied to the specific installation location on the project Docker image.
