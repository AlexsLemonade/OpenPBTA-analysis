# Molecular Subtyping ATRT

**Note: The files in the `atrt-subset` directory were generated via `00-subset-files-for-ATRT.R` using the the files in the [version 11 data release](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/pull/293).
When re-running this module, you may want to regenerate the ATRT subset files using the most recent data release.**
