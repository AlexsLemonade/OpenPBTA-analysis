# Molecular Subtyping ATRT

##### Note: The subset files generated in this module by the `00-subset-files-for-ATRT.R` script were generated using the files in the [version 11 data release](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/pull/293).
##### When re-running this module, you might want to make sure that the ATRT subset files are regenerated with the most recent data release.
