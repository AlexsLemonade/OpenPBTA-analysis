# Molecular Subtyping non-MB, non-ATRT Embryonal Tumors

**Note: The files in the `subset-files` directory were generated via `02-generate-subset-files.R` using the the files in the [version 13 data release](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/pull/444).**

When re-running this module, you may want to regenerate the subset files using the most recent data release.
Files will be regenerated using the symlinked files in `data` by default when running:

```sh
bash run-embryonal-subtyping.sh
```
