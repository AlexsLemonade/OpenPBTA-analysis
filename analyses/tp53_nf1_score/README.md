## Apply classifiers trained on TCGA RNA-seq data

**Module author:** Krutika Gaonkar ([@kgaonkar6](https://github.com/kgaonkar6)) and Jaclyn Taroni (@jaclyn-taroni); code adapted from Gregory Way ([@gwaygenomics](https://github.com/gwaygenomics))

This module is adapted from: [`marislab/pdx-classification`](https://github.com/marislab/pdx-classification).
Now published in [Rokita et al. _Cell Reports._ 2019.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.071)

In brief, _TP53_ inactivation, _NF1_ inactivation, and Ras activation classifiers are applied to the stranded and polya OpenPBTA RNA-seq data.
The classifiers were trained on TCGA PanCan data ([Way et al. _Cell Reports._ 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.046), [Knijnenburg et al. _Cell Reports._ 2018.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076)).
See [`01-apply-classifier.py`](01-apply-classifier.py) for more information about the procedure.
To evaluate the classifier scores, we use [`02-evaluate-classifier.py`](02-evaluate-classifier.py) and input SNV data to identify true TP53/NF1 loss samples and compare scores of shuffled data to true calls and plot ROC curves. 

**This module is in progress.** 
Copy number aberrations are not currently considered when evaluating the classifiers.

#### Running the analysis

The analysis can be run with the following (assuming you are in the root repository of the project):

```
bash analyses/tp53_nf1_score/run_classifier.sh
```

### Order of analysis

`00-tp53-nf1-alterations.R` produces `TP53_NF1_snv_alteration.tsv`, which contains information about the presence or absence of coding SNVs in _TP53_ and _NF1_ for the purpose of evaluating the classifier results.
For evaluation purposes, a coding SNV 1) is found in a CDS region and 2) is not a silent mutation or in an intron as indicated by the `Variant_Classification` column of the consensus mutation file.
_NF1_ positive examples are additionally filtered to remove missense mutations, as these are not annotated with OncoKB ([#381 (comment)](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/pull/381#issuecomment-570748578)).

`01-apply-classifier.py` produces  `results/pbta-gene-expression-rsem-fpkm-collapsed.stranded_classifier_scores.tsv`  and `results/pbta-gene-expression-rsem-fpkm-collapsed.polya_classifier_scores.tsv`, which contains all 3 classifier scores for the stranded data and for shuffled stranded (e.g., random) data.

`02-qc-rna_expression_score.Rmd` here expression of TP53 gene was compared to TP53 classifier score. We didn't find a strong correlation between TP53 expression and TP53 inactivation score, thus, expression and classifier score together cannot predict function.

`03-tp53-cnv-loss-domain.Rmd` here copy_number of regions overlapping TP53 functional domains were compared to TP53 classifier score. We find tumors with TP53 copies <=1 have higher TP53 classifier scores, so we only retain biospecimens with <= 1 copy TP53 as high confidence TP53 loss. 

`04-tp53-sv-loss.Rmd` here structural variant breakpoints overlapping TP53 are investigated for CNV loss or low expression to gather high confidence TP53 loss via Structural Variants. 

`05-tp53-altered-annotation.Rmd` here we take a deeper look into tp53 altered status with respect to number of SNVs/CNVs suggesting bi-allelic mutations or with respect to cancer_predisposition and tp53 classifier scores.

`05-evaluate-classifier.py` evaluates classifier score with TP53 alterations (non-synonymous SNV and all status == "loss" in consensus CNV file from 00-tp53-nf1-alterations.R) 

Because some of the classifier genes are not present in the OpenPBTA dataset, the scores should be interpreted as continuous values representing relative gene alterations and not as probabilities.
