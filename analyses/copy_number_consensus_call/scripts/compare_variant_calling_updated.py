################## PURPOSE #################

# This script is to do PAIR comparisons using the three 3 caller CNVs files
# This script takes in the 3 caller CNVs files and put their content in to a nested dictionary.
# There are 3 dictionaries within the bigger dictionary , each dictionary is the content of a singular caller method.

# For-loops are used to loop through these 3 files to do pair comparison of the 3 files.
# We compare manta - cnvkit
# then  manta - freec
# and finally cnvkit - freec
# We'll end up with 3 output files.

# The principle for finding consensus CNVs is that if any two CNVs overlap at least 50% reciprocally, we will
# take the common section of those overlapping CNVs as the new consensus CNV.

################# Output format ###############
