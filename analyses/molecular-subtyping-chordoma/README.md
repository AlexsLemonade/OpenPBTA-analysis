This module looks at _SMARCB1_ focal copy status and expression levels.

It can be run via the command line with the following:

```
bash run-molecular-subtyping-chordoma.sh
```
In this bash script we will filter histologies file with pathology_diagnosis=="Chordoma" to select for chordoma samples and then run the main notebook that looks at _SMARCB1_ focal copy status and expression levels.
