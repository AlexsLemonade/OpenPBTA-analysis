This module looks at _SMARCB1_ focal copy status and expression levels.

It can be run via the command line with the following:

```
bash run-molecular-subtyping-chordoma.sh
```
This bash script the same regardless of where it is called and will first subset the data to `Chordoma` samples
and then run the main notebook that looks at _SMARCB1_ focal copy status and expression levels.
