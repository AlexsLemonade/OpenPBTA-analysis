#### Objectives

Compare D3b and CCDL TMB calculations as a response to this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/issues/729#issuecomment-658259843). 

This includes CCDL TMB calculations that used mutation sets with FoCR-defined nonsynonymous filter and maftools-defined nonsynonymous filter. 

We generally treat CCDL's maftools-defined filtered dataset as the benchmark since its the TMB currently in the data release (as of 09-09-2020). 

These TMB datasets compared here are obtained by running:

```
bash analyses/snv-callers/explore_variant_classifications/run_explorations.sh
```

### Summary of findings: 

Mutation counts seem to be fairly related but the bed sizes are very different and that seems to be what's causing the differences in TMB calculations ranges.
CCDL TMB is a much larger range (0 - ~300), while D3B TMB is smaller range (0 - ~5) because the BED size for CCDL TMB is much smaller than the BED size for D3B TMB.

### Usage

To run this from the command line, use:
```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analyses/tmb-compare/compare-tmb-calculations.Rmd', 
                              clean = TRUE)"
```

_This assumes you are in the top directory of the repository._

## Setup

```{r}
# magrittr pipe
`%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
```

Declare names of input and output directories.

```{r}
data_dir <- file.path("..", "..", "data")
scratch_dir <- file.path("..", "..", "scratch")
```

Custom function for plotting the TMB. 

```{r}
source(file.path("util", "cdf-plot-function.R"))
```

## Set up consensus data

Read in the three consensus TMB files. 

This is the main TMB that is used in other downstream results. 

```{r}
tmb_ccdl_maftools <- data.table::fread(file.path(
  "..",
  "snv-callers",
  "results",
  "consensus",
  "pbta-snv-mutation-tmb-coding.tsv"
))
```

This is the FoCR-defined filter TMB results. 

```{r}
tmb_ccdl_focr <- data.table::fread(file.path(
  "..",
  "snv-callers",
  "results",
  "focr_filter",
  "pbta-snv-mutation-tmb-coding.tsv"
))
```

This is the d3b calculated results. 

```{r}
tmb_d3b <- data.table::fread(file.path(
  "TMB_d3b_code",
  "outputs",
  "pbta-snv-consensus-TMB_intarget.txt"
))
```

Combine the three datasets into one data.frame. 

```{r}
all_tmb <- tmb_ccdl_maftools %>% 
  dplyr::inner_join(tmb_ccdl_focr, by = "Tumor_Sample_Barcode", 
                    suffix = c("_maftools", "_focr")) %>% 
  dplyr::inner_join(tmb_d3b, by = "Tumor_Sample_Barcode") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(tmb_d3b = TMB, 
                mutation_count_d3b = count)
```

## Fraction differences in TMB

Here we use the CCDL's maftools-defined filtered TMB for the denominator since its the current TMB. 

Calculate fraction differences in relation to maftools-defined filtered TMB. 

```{r}
all_tmb <- all_tmb %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(frac_diff_focr = (tmb_maftools - tmb_focr) / tmb_maftools, 
                frac_diff_d3b = (tmb_maftools - tmb_d3b) / tmb_maftools)
```

Let's plot the distribution of fraction differences from both d3b and focr-defined TMBs. 

```{r}
all_tmb %>% 
  dplyr::select(dplyr::starts_with("frac_diff")) %>% 
  tidyr::gather("tmb_calculation_set", "frac_diff") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(tmb_calculation_set = gsub("frac_diff_", "", tmb_calculation_set)) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = frac_diff, color = tmb_calculation_set)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_density() + 
  ggplot2::theme_classic() + 
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Fraction difference in TMB in comparison to CCDL maftools-defined TMB")
```

Most of the D3b TMBs are very different. 
Most of the FoCR-defined TMB are not too different but there's some with big differences.

We'll investigate these a bit. 
Let's identify which samples have the biggest differences for FoCR-defined TMB.

```{r}
all_tmb %>% 
  dplyr::filter(abs(frac_diff_focr) > .05) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(frac_diff_focr))
```

TMB is very different between CCDL and D3b calculations fraction wise. 
The ranges for the CCDL sets and the D3b sets are very different.  

```{r}
cat(
  " Range for CCDL maftools-defined TMB:", range(all_tmb$tmb_maftools), "\n",
  "Range for CCDL focr-defined TMB:", range(all_tmb$tmb_focr), "\n",
  "Range for D3b TMB:", range(all_tmb$tmb_d3b)
  )
```

Let's split up the TMB fraction to see where this vast difference in ranges might be. 

## How different are mutation counts?

Let's take a look at the numerator of the TMB fraction by selecting the counts columns only. 

```{r}
counts_only <- all_tmb %>% 
  dplyr::select(mutation_count_focr, mutation_count_maftools, mutation_count_d3b)

# Print this out
counts_only
```

Let's plot these counts correlations, but turn them into log1p values for easier visualization.

```{r}
counts_only %>%
  dplyr::transmute_all(log1p) %>%
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = ggplot2::aes(alpha = 0.05)) +
  ggplot2::theme_classic()
```

The samples with high TMB, still usually have a higher TMB in the other datasets. 

Let's take a closer look at one of the comparisons, comparing the FoCR counts to the D3B counts, which should use the same criteria for inclusion.

```{r}
counts_only %>%
  dplyr::transmute_all(log1p) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = mutation_count_maftools, y = mutation_count_d3b)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point() + 
  ggplot2::geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "blue") + 
  ggplot2::theme_classic()
```

The FoCR count always greater than or equal to the D3B count, despite the fact that these should be using the same criteria and data files. 
(The maftools count is also strictly greater than or equal to the FoCR count, as expected by its broader criteria for inclusion.)

Let's take a closer look at the samples with larger differences in counts. 
We'll compare things with `mutation_count_maftools` since that is what is in the current consensus file. 

```{r}
all_tmb %>%
  dplyr::transmute(
    Tumor_Sample_Barcode,
    ccdl_filter_diff = mutation_count_maftools - mutation_count_focr,
    ccdl_filter_diff_frac = ccdl_filter_diff / (mutation_count_maftools +1), 
    d3b_diff = mutation_count_maftools - mutation_count_d3b,
    d3b_diff_frac = d3b_diff / (mutation_count_maftools +1)
    ) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(ccdl_filter_diff))
```

Some of the HGAT samples are the ones with the biggest differences in counts. 

## How different are BED sizes?

Let's take a look at the denominator of TMB. 

Both CCDL TMBs use the same bed regions so it doesn't matter if we use `region_size_focr` or `region_size_maftools`. 

```{r}
all_tmb %>%
  dplyr::rename(ccdl_bed_size = region_size_focr, d3b_bed_size = bedlength) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(ccdl_bed_size, d3b_bed_size, experimental_strategy) %>%
  dplyr::tally()
```

So the bed sizes are very different and that seems to be what's causing the differences in TMB calculations.
