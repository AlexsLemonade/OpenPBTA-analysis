#### Purpose

Compare D3b and CCDL TMB calculations as a response to this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/issues/729#issuecomment-658259843).

### Summary of findings: 

Mutation counts seem to be fairly related but the bed sizes are very different and that seems to be what's causing the differences in TMB calculations ranges.
CCDL TMB is a much larger range (0 - ~300), while D3B TMB is smaller range (0 - ~5) but that is because the BED size for CCDL TMB is much smaller than the BED size for D3B TMB. 
This problem is exacerbated in (mostly) HGAT samples because they outliers and seem to have some high variance (we've seen this before).

#### Usage

To run this from the command line, use:
```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analyses/tmb-compare/compare-tmb-calculations.Rmd', 
                              clean = TRUE)"
```

_This assumes you are in the top directory of the repository._

## Setup

#### Packages and functions

```{r}
# magrittr pipe
`%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
```

Declare names of input and output directories.

```{r}
data_dir <- file.path("..", "..", "data")
scratch_dir <- file.path("..", "..", "scratch")
```

Custom function for plotting the TMB. 

```{r}
source(file.path("util", "cdf-plot-function.R"))
```

## Set up consensus data

Read in the two consensus TMB files. 

```{r}
tmb_ccdl <- data.table::fread(file.path(
  "..",
  "snv-callers",
  "results",
  "consensus",
  "pbta-snv-mutation-tmb-coding.tsv"
))
```

```{r}
tmb_d3b <- data.table::fread(file.path(
  "TMB_d3b_code",
  "outputs",
  "pbta-snv-consensus-TMB_intarget.txt"
))
```

Combine the two datasets into one data.frame. 

```{r}
all_tmb <- tmb_ccdl %>% 
  dplyr::inner_join(tmb_d3b, by = "Tumor_Sample_Barcode") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(tmb_d3b = TMB, 
                tmb_ccdl = tmb)
```

## Calculate percent difference in TMB

```{r}
all_tmb <- all_tmb %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    diff = abs(tmb_d3b - tmb_ccdl),
    perc_diff  = diff/max(tmb_ccdl, tmb_d3b)
    ) 
```

Plot the percent difference. 

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(all_tmb, 
                ggplot2::aes(x = experimental_strategy.x, y = perc_diff, fill = experimental_strategy.x)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_violin() + 
  ggplot2::theme_classic() +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

### Which samples are really differing in TMB calculations 

```{r}
all_tmb %>% 
  dplyr::filter(perc_diff > .05)
```

Most are HGAT. 

## How different are the counts?

```{r}
all_tmb %>% 
  dplyr::filter(perc_diff > .05) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = mutation_count, y = count, color = short_histology)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point() + 
  ggplot2::ylab("D3B mutation count") +
  ggplot2::xlab("CCDL mutation count") + 
  ggplot2::theme_classic()
```

Counts look mostly the same. 

## Calculate percent difference in BED size

```{r}
all_tmb <- all_tmb %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    bed_diff = abs(region_size - bedlength),
    bed_perc_diff  = bed_diff/max(region_size, bedlength)
    ) 
```

Let's make a table of this.

```{r}
all_tmb %>%
  dplyr::rename(ccdl_bed_size = region_size, d3b_bed_size = bedlength) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(ccdl_bed_size, d3b_bed_size) %>%
  dplyr::tally()
```

So the bed sizes are very different and that seems to be what's causing the differences in TMB calculations. 
This problem is exacerbated by HGAT samples because they outliers and seem to have some high variance typically. 

## Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
