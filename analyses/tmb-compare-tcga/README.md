# Tumor Mutation Burden Compare to TCGA

This analysis compares the Pediatric Brain Tumor samples of this dataset to the adult brain tumor samples from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga).

## Usage

To run this from the command line, first, the `snv-caller` scripts: `snv-caller/run_caller_consensus_analysis-tcga.sh` and `snv-caller/run_caller_consensus_analysis-pbta.sh` must be run.  
The results from those scripts are saved to `snv-caller/results/consensus/` folder and used here. 
Some versions of these files are incorporated into the data release and saved to `data` folder so this module could be altered to use the file versions in the `data` folder.  
Then you can run this module's analysis by the following command to create the plot: 
```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analyses/tmb-compare-tcga/compare-tmb.Rmd',
                              clean = TRUE)"
```
These steps are also run soup to nutes in the figures script: `figures/scripts/fig2-mutational-landscape.R`. 

## Results

The results of this analysis are the TMB calculations for PBTA and TCGA datasets plotted side by side:

Additionally, the resulting TCGA TMB calculations used are saved to `results/brain_related_tcga_tmb.tsv` in this folder.

## Summary of Methods

Overall, tumor mutation burden for both brain tumor datasets are calculated using mutations from exonic regions of the genome only.  

### PBTA Tumor Mutation Burden

The TMB calculations for the pediatric brain tumor set were carried out in [snv-callers analysis](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/tree/master/analyses/snv-callers) in this repository.
In brief, tumor mutation burden is calculated using all SNV calls found by both
[Mutect2](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect) and [Strelka2](https://github.com/Illumina/strelka) found in coding sequences.
The total number coding sequence consensus SNVs were used for the numerator and the effective size of the genome surveyed is used as the denominator.

```
TMB = (total # coding sequence consensus snvs) / (size of effectively surveyed genome)
```

For more details, see [snv-callers README](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/tree/master/analyses/snv-callers).

### TCGA Tumor Mutation Burden

For calculating TCGA tumor mutation burden, TCGA brain-related tumor projects only were used:

- [LGG (Lower-grade Glioma)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1402121)
- [GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910500/)

The size of the [exome BED regions file included with the MC3 project](https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/7f0d3ab9-8bef-4e3b-928a-6090caae885b) overlapped with the same coding sequences used for PBTA data.
