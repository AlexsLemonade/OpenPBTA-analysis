# Molecular Subtyping High-grade Gliomas

**Note: The files in the `hgg-subset` directory were generated via `02-HGG-molecular-subtyping-subset-files.R` using the the files in the [version 12 data release](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/pull/347).
When re-running this module, you may want to regenerate the HGG subset files using the most recent data release.**
