7316-22	NA	The findings are c/w isochromosome 17q and gain of the long arm of chromosome 18. There is no evidence for amplification of MYC or MYCN. This tumor demonstrate some features of the anaplastic type such as marked nuclear pleomorphism high mitotic activity and abundant apoptotic bodies, however significant cell wrapping or molding is not present therefore it falls short of all the features of severe anaplasia required for the anaplastic subtype.
7316-906	WNT	All of the cells demonstrated loss of chromosome 6 (monosomy 6). In ddition, approximately 30% of cells had a deletion of most of the short arm of chromosome 17, including TP53. Approximately 10% of cells had loss of the X chromosome. Monosomy 6 is assoicated with the WNT subgroup of medulloblastoma, and predicts a good prognosis.

The results are consistent with, but not diagnostic, for a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the brain. MYCN amplification would be considered apoor prognostic indicator.

The deletion in 22 includes the NF2 locus. This finding, in combination with the structural abnormalities of chromosome 1, is characteristic of meningioma.

7316-467	NA	There were five copies of chromosome 2, confirmed by FISH with probes for MYCN and PAX3. The highest number of copies were observed for 1q,4q,6,7,8,9q,12,17 and 18. There were no small deletions or regions of amplification, including MYC or MYCN. The likely mechanism for these findings is a doubling of a triploid to tetraploid tumor. The results are consistent with a very high grade lesion, but it is not possible to distinguish a grade IV glioma from a medulloblastoma based on these studies alone.
7316-842	NA	classic type
7316-179	NA	High resolution SNP array studies were performed on this tumor specimen, which did not reveal any pathogenic copy number alterations. Four regions of homozygosity, present in the germline, were noted in chromosomes 6,13,15 and 22. Any of these may unmask a recessive mutation. Of interest the chromosome 6 region includes the ARID1B locus. ARID1B is a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Mutations of this gene have been reported in a variety of tumors in adults and children, including medulloblastoma.
