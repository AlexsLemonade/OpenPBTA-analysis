## Molecular Subtype Classification (MB)

**Module authors:** Komal S. Rathi ([@komalsrathi](https://github.com/komalsrathi))

### Description

The goal of this analysis is to leverage the R packages [medulloPackage](https://github.com/d3b-center/medullo-classifier-package) and [MM2S](https://github.com/cran/MM2S) that utilize expression data from RNA-seq or array to classify the medulloblastoma (MB) samples into four subtypes i.e Group3, Group4, SHH, WNT. The input is a log-normalized FPKM matrix with gene symbols as rownames in case of medulloPackage and entrez ids as rownames in case of MM2S.  

The analysis uses a combined matrix of polyA selected (n = 1) and rRNA depleted (n = 121) MB samples as input.

### Running the full analysis

This runs 01 - 03 scripts to create all the output in the `results/` folder.

```sh
bash run-molecular-subtyping-mb.sh
```

### Analysis scripts

#### 00-mb-select-pathology-dx.Rmd

1. Inputs

```
data/histologies.tsv
```

2. Function

_This 00 script is not run by calling run-molecular-subtyping-mb.sh_ but can be run separately using this command:

```sh
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analyses/molecular-subtyping-MB/00-mb-select-pathology-dx.Rmd', clean = TRUE)"
```

This Rmd checks the alignment of `Medulloblastoma` labels across fields:  `pathology_diagnosis`, `integrated_diagnosis`, and `short_histology`.
This creates a terms JSON which is used in the other scripts for subsetting.

3. Output:

A medulloblastoma terms JSON file:
`molecular-subtyping-MB/inputs/mb_subtyping_path_dx_strings.json`

#### 01-filter-and-batch-correction.R

1. Inputs

```
# the rna-seq expression files
data/gene-expression-rsem-tpm-collapsed.rds

# histologies file
data/histologies.tsv

# medulloblastoma terms file
molecular-subtyping-MB/inputs/mb_subtyping_path_dx_strings.json
```

2. Function

This script first subsets the input expression matrix to MB samples only and generates a log-normalized FPKM matrix.

In case batch-correction of the input matrix is required, we need to set `--batch_col` with the column in the clinical file corresponding to the batch variable. For this analysis, we don't need to batch correct the input matrix, so we will be setting `--batch_col` to `NULL`.

3. Output:

```
# subset clinical file to medulloblastoma biospecimens only
input/subset-mb-clinical.tsv

# log-normalized matrix with medulloblastoma biospecimens only
results/medulloblastoma-exprs.rds
```

#### 02-classify-mb.R

1. Input

```
# log-normalized matrix with medulloblastoma biospecimens only
results/medulloblastoma-exprs.rds
```

2. Function:

This script runs the two classifiers on both uncorrected and batch-corrected input matrices. In order to run MM2S, the script utilizes the R package `org.Hs.eg.db`  to convert gene symbols to Entrez ids.

3. Output

```
results/mb-classified.rds
```

The .rds object contains a list of dataframes with outputs corresponding to the twp classifier runs. Each dataframe contains 5 columns: sample (Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID), best.fit (i.e. medulloblastoma subtype assigned to the sample), classifier (MM2S or medulloPackage), dataset (corrected or uncorrected matrix) and score (in case of MM2S) or p-value (in case of medulloPackage).  

#### 03-compare-classes.Rmd

1. Input

```
# subset clinical file to medulloblastoma biospecimens only
input/subset-mb-clinical.tsv

# expected output from pathology reports
input/openPBTA-mb-pathology-subtypes.rds

# observed output from 01-classify-mb.R
results/mb-classified.rds
```

TODO: `input/openPBTA-mb-pathology-subtypes.rds` doesn't have much information surrounding it, but [this is issue has been tracked](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/issues/746) and this README can be updated once that has been addressed.

2. Function:

This notebook summarizes the performance of the two classifiers on the input expression matrix obtained after running 02-classify-mb.R.

The observed subtypes obtained from each classifier are compared to the expected subtypes in the pathology report in order to determine the classifier accuracy. % Accuracy is calculated by matching observed and expected subtypes only where expected subtype information is available. In case of ambiguous subtypes, a match is determined only if the observed subtype matches with any one of the expected subtypes.

The pathology report has subtype information on 43/122 (35.2%) samples. Following is the breakdown of pathology identified subtypes:

| pathology_subtype | freq |
|-------------------|------|
| Group 3 or 4      | 14   |
| Group 4           | 5    |
| non-WNT           | 9    |
| SHH               | 10   |
| WNT               | 5    |

3. Output

The markdown produces one html notebook and a tab-delimited file containing RNA and DNA identifiers mapped to the consensus molecular subtype obtained for each input matrix.

```
# html output
02-compare-classes.html

# tsv files containing RNA and DNA identifiers mapped to molecular_subtype
results/MB_molecular_subtype.tsv
```

#### Accuracy and Final output

For our dataset, medulloPackage is able to classify the input samples with 95.35% accuracy whereas MM2S shows an accuracy of 83.72%. Comparing the accuracy of the two classifiers, the molecular subtype is determined by using the prediction obtained from `medulloPackage` classifier.
