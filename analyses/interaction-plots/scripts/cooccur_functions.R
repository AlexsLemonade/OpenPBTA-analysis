#' Filter mutations based on VAF and effect
#'
#' @param maf_df a data frame of a maf file or subset of one. Minimally includes
#'   `Consequence` column and either `vaf` or both `t_ref_count` and `t_alt_count`.

#' @param exclude_consequence A vector of consequences (as strings) that should
#'   be excluded in the filtered results. Note that if a mutation has multiple
#'   consequences, it will not be excluded unless ALL consequences are excluded.
#' @param include_consequence A vector of consequences (as strings) that should
#'   be included in the filtered results.
#'
#' @return A filtered data frame, with the same columns as the input `maf_df`,
#'   with VAF added if not already present.

#' Calculate co-occurence relationships for a list of genes
#'
#' @param gene_sample_df a data frame with columns `gene`, `sample`, and
#'   `mutations` where each row represents a gene mutated in the named
#'   sample, and `mutations` is the number of mutations in that gene-sample
#'   combination.
#' @param genes a vector of genes for which co-occurence data is to be calculated.
#'   Default is to pick a random subset, though this is almost never what
#'   is wanted! (Note that all-by-all comparisons is likely to be extremely
#'   slow).
#' @param samples Which samples should the comparison include. Defaults to all
#'   samples present in the data frame.
#'
#' @return A data frame summarizing the co-occurence of pairs of genes in the
#'   gene list with columns `gene1`; `gene2`; counts of each mutations in
#'   each category of sharing (`mut11`: both mutated; `mut10`: mutated in
#'   the first but not second gene, etc.); `odds_ratio` for co-occurence,
#'   `cooccur_sign`: 1 if co-occurence greater than by chance, -1 if less
#'   frequent than expected; `p` the fisher's exact test p value; and a
#'   `cooccur_score` calucated as `cooccur_sign * -log10(p)`.
