  # Arguments: 
  # detect_mat: a matrix, where each column represents a caller and contains a TRUE/FALSE 
  #            for whether a mutation was detected. 
  # plot_file_path: File path to where the plot will be saved to as png. 
  # subset_vector: (Optional) a vector to be supplied to dplyr::filter() that will subset the
  #                detect_mat and create the upset plot from that subset.
  # has_vardict: Does detect_mat contain VarDict as well? TRUE/FALSE. Default is TRUE.
  #
  # Output: An upset plot that represents the number of mutations detected by the combinations of callers
