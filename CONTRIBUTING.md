# Contribution guidelines for the OpenPBTA-analysis

## Issues

The best place to initially engage with the project is likely to be via creation of new issues or participation in existing issues.
We use issues to address difficulties interacting with the data, limitations of the current data processing approaches, or other roadblocks.
We also use issues for discussion of analyses.
Participants who wish to perform an analysis of the data as part of this effort should either identify an existing, planned analysis that they wish to tackle or propose a new one.

## Pull requests

Contributions to the analysis repository operate on a pull request model.
We expect participants to actively review pull requests, with a particular focus on pull requests that include analyses within their areas of expertise.

### Filing a pull request from your own branch

Here, we include a _typical_ workflow for filing a pull request to contribute to this project.

1. Fork this repository to your own account: https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo
2. Treat `AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis` as an upstream repository. 
You should follow these instructions for configuring a remote that points to an upstream repository here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork
3. When you want to make changes and ultimately file a pull request against the `master` branch of this repository, you can start by making a branch from the `master` branch of your fork named for the changes you intend to make. 
For example, you could name your branch `gene-expression-clustering` 
Then, [check out the new branch](https://gist.github.com/markSci5/5916003) (e.g., `gene-expression-clustering`).
Commit and push your changes to this branch. 
You will then be able to file a pull request from this branch: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork
4. Once your pull request is approved and merged by the project maintainers, it's time to keep the `master` branch of your fork up-to-date with the `master` branch of this repository by following this process: https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork.
Here's a typical series of steps for performing that:
```
# fetch the changes from the AlexsLemonade repository
git fetch upstream

# checkout your own master branch
git checkout master

# merge the upstream/master branch into your own master branch
git merge upstream/master

# push the changes to your master branch to the remote repository
git push
```
You do not want to commit changes to your `master` branch, any changes to your `master` branch should come from the upstream `master` branch.

## Authorship

The ultimate goal of this is effort is to describe the results of our analyses in a manuscript.
We will use the [ICMJE Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html).
We expect authors to contribute to the overall design of the project by participating in issues, to contribute analyses via filing pull requests that integrate analyses into this repository, to contribute to the text by contributing sections and/or revisions to sections through pull requests on the [OpenPBTA-manuscript repository](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-manuscript/).
It is important to note that, for authorship, these should be substantial intellectual contributions.

## Peer review

All pull requests will undergo peer review.
Participants in this project should review pull requests, which can be done using [GitHub's review interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/ "GitHub: about pull request reviews").
They should suggest modifications or, potentially, directly edit the pull request to make suggested changes.
As a reviewer, it's helpful to note the type of review you performed: did you look over the source code, did you run the source code, did you look at and interpret the results or a combination of these?

Before a repository maintainer merges a pull request, there must be at least one affirmative review.
If there is any unaddressed criticism or disapproval, a repository maintainer will determine how to proceed and may wait for additional feedback.
