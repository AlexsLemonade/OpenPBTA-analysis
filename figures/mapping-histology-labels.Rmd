# Purpose: 

The histology label variables included in `pbta-histologies.tsv` from data releases are not always useful for visualizing the full set of biospecimens due to the large number of different values.
Having too many different possible values makes the colors harder to distinguish.
In addition, there are some groups that are represented by only a very few samples; giving such groups a distinct color may be counterproductive.

The goal of this notebook is to use the currently existing `broad_histology` groups from `pbta-histologies.tsv`, to form 10-15 "high level histology" group labels that can used for plotting purposes.

## The output table

The output of this notebook is a TSV file: `palettes/histology_label_color_table.tsv` that contains the following fields:

**Copied from `pbta-histologies.tsv`**:    
- `Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID` (from `pbta-histologies.tsv`)  
- All the original histology label variables (`broad_histology`, `short_histology`, etc.)  
  
**Created in this notebook**:  
- `display_group` - the high-level histology labels that should be used for plotting   
- `hex_codes` the direct colors that should be used for plotting  

With this info, `histology_label_color_table.tsv` can be used by all plots and figures that summarize high level data  while displaying histology information. 

# How `display_group` is made:

Here's how `broad-histology` is [recoded into the high-level groupings of `display_group`](#make_new_display_group).

1) All biospecimens in `broad_histology` groups with fewer than the number of `small_groups_cutoff` will be now grouped together as `Other` in `display_group`. 

2) "Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumor" and "Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumor" were labeled as LGAT in previous releases so we will group these into `Low-grade astrocytic tumor` in `display_group`. 

3) So its clear why they are `NA`s, we will label all `Normal` samples (non-tumor samples) as `Normal` in `display_group`. 

4) Anything not in the above categories gets its `broad_histology` label carried over. 

# Usage

This notebook can be run via the command line from the top directory of the 
repository as follows:

```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('figures/mapping-histology-labels.Rmd', 
                              clean = TRUE)"
```

## Set Up

```{r}
# Magrittr pipe
`%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
```

For groups that are smaller than this cutoff, they will be put into an `Other` group in `display_group`. 

```{r}
small_groups_cutoff <- 12
```

### Directories and Files

```{r}
# Path to input directory
input_dir <- file.path("..", "data")
output_dir <- "palettes"
```

# Read in metadata 

Which variables are we keeping for this table? 

```{r}
histology_variables <- 
  c("Kids_First_Biospecimen_ID",
    "sample_type", 
    "integrated_diagnosis", 
    "Notes", 
    "harmonized_diagnosis",
    "broad_histology", 
    "short_histology")

```

Let's read in the current release's `pbta-histologies.tsv` file and select the histology variables we mentioned above. 

```{r}
metadata <-
  readr::read_tsv(file.path(input_dir, "pbta-histologies.tsv"), guess_max = 10000) %>% 
  dplyr::select(histology_variables)
```

# Take a look at how many biospecimens per `broad_histology` group

Let's summarize `broad_histology`. 
Because the `Normal` samples don't have histologies, we'll look at just the `Tumor` samples at for this summary. 

```{r}
broad_summary <- metadata %>% 
  dplyr::filter(sample_type == "Tumor") %>%
  dplyr::count(broad_histology, short_histology) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(n)
```

Let's print out the summary. 

```{r}
broad_summary %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

There's handful of very small groups (many are n = 2). 

## Declare new equivalent groups

Previously samples with these labels were generally considered `LGAT` groups, so we will group them back in in `display_group`. 

```{r}
lgat_adjacent <- c("Low-grade astrocytic tumor",
                   "Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumor",
                   "Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumor")
```

These groups we'll combine non-CNS. 

```{r}
non_cns <- c("Non-CNS tumor", "Germ cell tumor")
```

These groups we'll combine as a benign.

```{r}
begnign <- c("Benign tumor", "Non-tumor")
```

# Make new `display_group`

This [logic is described at the top of the notebook](#how_display_group_is_made:).

```{r}
histology_table <- metadata %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    display_group = forcats::fct_collapse(broad_histology,
      "Low-grade astrocytic tumor and adjacent" = lgat_adjacent,
      "Non-CNS tumor" = non_cns,
      "Benign" = begnign
    )
    )
```

Print out the number of `display_group` (including `Normal`)!

```{r}
display_group_df <- histology_table %>% 
  dplyr::count(display_group)

knitr::kable(display_group_df)
```

Make this notebook stop if there are more than 15 groups. 

```{r}
if (nrow(display_group_df) > 15) {
  stop("There's more than 15 `display_group` may want to re-evaluate the high-level histology groupings")
}
```

# Add hex codes 

These hex codes were retrieved from http://phrogz.net/css/distinct-colors.html with the settings on default for 18 colors.

```{r}
color_palette <- 
  c("#ff0000", "#cc0000", "#995200", "#bfb300", "#fffbbf", 
    "#2e7300", "#00e65c", "#00ffee", "#103d40", "#0085a6", 
    "#003380", "#4073ff", "#737899", "#70008c", "#f2b6ee", 
    "#ff40bf", "#8c0038", "#330d12"
)
```

Declare how many colors we need. 

```{r}
n_colors <- nrow(display_group_df)
```

Make a named list color key where histologies are the names. 

```{r}
# Set seed so the colors are consistent upon re-run
set.seed(2021)

# Sample from the 18 colors
subset_colors <- sample(color_palette, n_colors)
names(subset_colors) <- display_group_df$display_group
```

Use `pie` function to preview what these look like.

```{r}
pie(rep(1, n_colors), 
    col = subset_colors, 
    labels = display_group_df$display_group)
```

Add the hex codes to the `histology_table`. 

```{r}
histology_table <- histology_table %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(hex_codes = dplyr::recode(display_group, hex_codes = !!!subset_colors))
```

## Save to TSV 

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(histology_table, file.path(output_dir, "histology_label_color_table.tsv"))
```

# Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
