### Figure 4

Figure 4 is compiled from the output of two figure scripts:

* `figures/scripts/TelomeraseActivities.R`
* `figures/scripts/fig4-panels-gsva-umap.R`

The individual panels can be found in `panels`.
They are compiled via Adobe Illustrator, saved as a PDF to this directory, and then a PNG file is exported to `figures/pngs`.
