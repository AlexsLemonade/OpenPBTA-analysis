### Figure 2

Figure 2 (`figure2.pdf`) is compiled from the output of `figures/scripts/fig2-oncoprint-landscape.R`

The individual panels and legends can be found in `panels`.
They are compiled via Adobe Illustrator, saved as a PDF to this directory, and then a PNG file is exported to `figures/pngs`.
